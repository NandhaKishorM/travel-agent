## Summary
Implement multi-agent system architecture for comprehensive travel planning with specialized hotel search and review analysis.

## Changes Made
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Restructured agent.py to implement a multi-agent system with four specialized agents:
  - `master_coordinator`: Main travel agent with core travel tools (places, geocoding, directions, weather)
  - `agent_hotels`: Hotel search specialist using Tavily API
  - `agent_reviews`: Hotel review aggregator collecting reviews from multiple platforms (TripAdvisor, Google, social media)
  - `agent_planner`: Final travel plan compiler that combines all agent outputs
- **Agent Registry System**: Added dynamic agent detection and tool routing via AGENT_REGISTRY
- **Conditional Agent Orchestration**: Implemented intelligent workflow that activates hotel agents only when accommodations are mentioned
- **Cross-Platform Review Collection**: Enhanced hotel reviews tool to search across 6 platforms with error handling
- **Trace Aggregation**: Combined execution traces from all agents for comprehensive debugging and monitoring
- **TravelAgent Class**: Refactored main interface to coordinate multi-agent workflow and return consolidated results
