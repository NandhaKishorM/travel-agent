### Core Capabilities
- Task delegation to specialized agents
- Response synthesis and coordination  
- User location identification
- Final travel plan assembly

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `get_current_location()` | Detect user's current location via IP | When user says "my location", "from here" |
| `get_current_date_time()` | Get current timestamp | For temporal context |
| `delegate_research()` | Route research tasks to Research Agent | Destination analysis requests |
| `delegate_planning()` | Route planning tasks to Planning Agent | Itinerary optimization requests |
| `delegate_location_analysis()` | Route location tasks to Location Agent | Geographic analysis requests |
| `delegate_timing_analysis()` | Route timing tasks to Timing Agent | Weather/temporal optimization |

### Decision Logic
```
User Query → Parse Intent → Identify Location (if needed) → Delegate to Specialists → Synthesize Results
```

## 🚀 Working Pipeline

### 1. Query Reception & Analysis
```
User Input → Master Coordinator → Intent Analysis → Location Detection (if needed)
```

### 2. Agent Delegation Strategy
```
Research Needed? → Delegate to Research Agent
Planning Required? → Delegate to Planning Agent  
Location Analysis? → Delegate to Location Agent
Weather/Timing? → Delegate to Timing Agent
```

### 3. Specialized Processing
```
Each Agent:
├── Receives delegated task
├── Uses specialized tools
├── Processes within domain expertise  
└── Returns structured results
```

### 4. Response Synthesis
```
Master Coordinator:
├── Collects all agent responses
├── Synthesizes into coherent plan
├── Resolves conflicts/overlaps
└── Delivers comprehensive result
```

## Example: "One day trip from my current location to Kannur"

### Pipeline Execution:

1. **Master Coordinator** receives query
2. **Master Coordinator** calls `get_current_location()` → identifies user location
3. **Delegates to Research Agent**: "Research Kannur attractions and experiences"
4. **Delegates to Planning Agent**: "Create one-day itinerary from [user location] to Kannur"
5. **Delegates to Location Agent**: "Analyze proximity and routes between locations"
6. **Delegates to Timing Agent**: "Check weather and optimal timing for travel"

### Agent Responses:
- **Research Agent**: Kannur attractions, culture, must-see places
- **Planning Agent**: Optimized route, transportation, schedule
- **Location Agent**: Distance analysis, route alternatives
- **Timing Agent**: Weather forecast, best travel times

### Final Output:
**Master Coordinator** synthesizes all responses into a comprehensive one-day travel plan with weather considerations, optimized routes, and curated experiences.
